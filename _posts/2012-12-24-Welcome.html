<p>Merry Christmas Eve! I talked to liu lijuan,this morning,want to get some information about you!
But she said nothing.Have you still be in German,or back Sweden?</p>
<p>When I come across with some guys,it's seems that they are all in happiness!Some one near by,maybe the best one who can give you a warm hug.</p>
<p>I don't like you to have a feeling that my all day is for you!Maybe that's true,but that's not what I want you to see</p>
